# Taara-V2

This is a documentation of my replication of Project Taara, now an independent company that was initially spearheaded by X, The Moonshot Factory. Taara is a Free Space Optical Communications System. This is a system of lasers and receivers used to transmit information at really fast speeds over moderate distances, designed to revolutionize last mile connectivity. 

This is an ongoing project and my current version is very inefficient and slow. However, I'm moving at breakneck speed and making constant updates to improve it.
